# Melbourne house price prediction

**Problem statement:**

This project plans to solve the problem of predicting housing prices in Melbourne and identifying the important variables for predicting prices. The only dependent variable is house prices. Eventually, the predicted results are compared with the actual prices. The project will use 3 performance metrics, i.e., adjusted R square, mean absolute percentage error, and AIC, to measure the models' performance.  

**Data Source:**

The data is collected from the Melbourne Housing Market dataset on Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market 

**Process:**

Built multiple multivariant regression models like LASSO regression to predict the house price and final model achieved adjusted r squared 81%.
